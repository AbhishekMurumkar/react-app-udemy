Planning 
	1. COMPONENT TREE/STRUCTURE
	2. APPLICATION STATE (DATA)
	3. COMPONENT VS CONTAINER

For Burger builder:
	1. In ui,
		in header we can have logo 
		in builder, we can see preview of burger with ingrediensts.Thus to modfy content of it we need some controls to edit the content of the ingredients where for each ingredient we need to add + or - button to add or remove them from the stack
		in footer we need to have checkout button showing the price of burger from ingredients present in the burger

		TREE:
App->
	Layout ->
	Tool bar ->
			drawer toggle
			logo
			navigation items

	side bar ->
				logo
				navigation items
	back drop
	props children ->
					burger builder page/comp ->
												build controls ->
																 list of individaul build components

																 order button
												preview of burger -> 
																	list of individual ingedrients comp


												modal to checkout -> 
																	wrapper comp

	2. STATE AND STATELESS DESIGN:
		here we need to record state of
		1. ingredients{meat:1,cheese:2}
		2. purchased: boolean
		3. totalprice: number

App->
	Layout ->
	Tool bar ->
			drawer toggle
			logo
			navigation items

	side bar ->
				logo
				navigation items
	back drop
	props children ->
					burger builder page/comp :
						here we are building the state full component rather than the App comp since then we will have page where we can see all prev orders and ingredients etc.

												build controls ->
																 list of individaul build components

																 order button
												preview of burger -> 
																	list of individual ingedrients comp


												modal to checkout ->
