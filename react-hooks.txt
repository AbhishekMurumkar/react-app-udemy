life cycle hooks methods of react are not react hooks.
React Hooks - these are javascript function which can only be used from inside funcional component or other hooks.
The hooks have nothing to do with lifecycle hooks of react.
idea behind using hooks:
1.expose certain (state) functionalities to functional components like managing state & using life cycle methods different than class based components.
2. highly reusable code and independent for each component.
3. you can use one and same hook in multiple functional components.
4. use hook in each place independent of component being used.
5. we use hooks to share functionality (not data) b/w components
6. we can add logic to multiple components but every component will run that logic on its own

Summary:allows to add state,have a life cycle method to functional components and to share logic(state)across components.
