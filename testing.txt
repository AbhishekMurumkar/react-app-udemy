Testing:
==>this is not done with manually, not always
==>Need to create some code to create tests, which is to be executed automatically
see testing.png

Required Testing Tools:
1) Test Runner : executes tests and provides validation library
    DONE By = Jest : comes with create-react-app , this is not only limited to react but also used to test with javascript coding
2) Test utilities: mounts components and allows to dig up into DOM
    Done By 1. React test utils
            2. Enzyme

What to test?
->Dont test the library
->Dont test complex connections
->Test the isolated units, test the component functions/ reducers 
->Test conditional outputs

Packages:
npm install --save enzyme react-test-renderer enzyme-adapter-react-16

enzyme Package allows us to render packages where independent of dependencies of our application, this helps in maintaining the unit tests.In order to use enzyme we need to
1) write a configuration to specify enzyme what, which component to load, this is done by enzyme-adapter-react-v.
2) then to re-render the component we need to use 'shallow' method, it renders component without deep-leveled
