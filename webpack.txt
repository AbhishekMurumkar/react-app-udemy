introduction of webpack:
bundler - convert multiple js to single js file
> optimizes files content
> transpliles es5,6 to javascript


working:
1. one entry point (app.js) which can lead to open multiple files
2. Loaders: file dependent transformations, applied changes to files based on file type
3. plugins: appliying changes to all content of text got from Loaders
4. output: correctly ordered, concatnated output (dist/output.js)

basic workflow req:
1. support next-gen javascript features => compile next-gen javascript concatnated
2. handle JSX
3. css AutoPrefixing
4. support image imports
5. optimize code
