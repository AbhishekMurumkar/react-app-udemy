Next.js: this is a framework based on react which is used to do server side rendering for the react apps 

ins: npm install --save next

Here we dont use the react routes instead we load the pages from the server.
this also includes the pre-rendering the content with code splits and load necessary components=>lazy loading

this is done by creating "pages" named folder in project root.
